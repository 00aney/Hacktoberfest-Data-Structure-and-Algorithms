# Contributing to this repo
* Try to keep things as modular as possible, for example if you are creating a LinkedList data structure for cpp, if there isn't a directory already created on the root of the directory named 'cpp' then create one, inside that directory create another folder called 'linkedlist', then create your file(s) inside the linkedlist folder.

## How To:

1. `git clone https://github.com/bareinhard/Hacktoberfest-Data-Structure-and-Algorithms`
2. `git checkout -b <Your-Branch-Name-Here>`
3. Code your files in the proper directory based on the instructions above
4. add all your files `git add your/directory/path/to/file/`
5. commit your file changes `git commit -m "Whatever you did here, e.g. created linkedlist class in C++"`
6. push your changes `git push origin <Your-Branch-Name-Here>`
7. Create a Pull Request to master
